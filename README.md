# C# Advent of Code Runner

## How to run
Copy your advent of code session cookie into `AdventOfCode/appsettings.json` so the runner can download your input files.

Run the `AdventOfCode` project with the arguments for `year` and `day` to run the solution for that day. 

Example: `dotnet run 2023 1`

## How to test
Run the `AdventOfCode.Tests` project to run the tests for all days.
